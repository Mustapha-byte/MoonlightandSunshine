        <h3>How It All Began</h3>
        <p>
        It all started on the Facebook app, where I spent my days connectin' with new friends. 
        Though I was deeply committed to my faith, I loved engagin' with others, especially ladies in my DMs.
        I shared insights about religious and offered advice on choosin' the right friends and future partners.
        Each day brought new connections, but one beautiful soul stood out: Fatmata Binta Juldeh Jalloh.
          <br><br>
        Her beauty captivated me, and I felt a special connection. I sent her a friend request, and to my delight, she accepted. At first, our conversations were simple—just greetin's and polite inquiries 
        about each other’s days. Communication was sparse, but I sensed there was potential for somethin' deeper.
          <br><br>
        One day, I decided to dive into a more meanin'ful conversation. As we shared our experiences and dreams, we began to understand each other better. Our connection blossomed, and I eagerly looked forward to every chat.
        <br /> That's not the end, read further...
        </p>

        <h3>Divertin' to WhatsApp</h3>
        <p>
        As our friendship deepened, Fatmata and I became almost inseparable. Our conversations were filled with laughter and joy, and I loved every moment we spent together, even if it was just through text. I was always online, eager to engage with her and with my friends in groups and comment sections.
          <br><br>
        So one day, I decided it was time to take our connection to the next level. I messaged her, <b><i>“Bestie, I don’t have much time for Facebook. Why don’t we continue our chats on WhatsApp? It would be super 
        cool! We can share voice messages and calls, which is so much easier. What do you think?”</i></b> To my 
        delight, she agreed.
          <br><br>
        However, there was a secret I had to share: I usually didn’t give out my number. I found it easier to manage connections that way. So, I asked her, <b><i>“How can we connect on WhatsApp?”</i></b> She quickly 
        shared her number, and I copied it right away, determined not to lose this precious opportunity, hahaha!
          <br><br>
        I mentioned that I had two WhatsApp accounts—one for personal use and another for general chats. Fatmata raised an eyebrow, curious about why I would keep my father on the general account. She 
        wondered if the private one was where I communicated with other ladies. I reassured her, clarifyin' my intentions and buildin' her trust. Once she understood, everythin' felt right between us.
          <br><br>
        We switched to WhatsApp, and our conversations flourished. We chatted day and night, deepenin' our bond and creatin' an extraordinary friendship that felt like it was meant to be.
        </p>

        <h3>This Crazy and Funny Love Start</h3>
        <p>
        As our daily conversations continued, it became clear that we were both developin' feelin's for each other—feelin's we hid behind the mountains of our friendship. Days passed, and I decided to take a leap of faith. Despite bein' “in a relationship” with my beloved friend Fatmata, I was drawn to her name, reminiscent of “Fatimah,” which I adored.
        <br><br>
        I nervously approached my dear friend, hopin' for a positive response. She asked for some time to think about it, and I agreed, holdin' my breath. A few days later, she told me she’d be open to datin' me but with one condition. She needed to know I wasn’t with anyone else.
        <br><br>
        In a moment of panic, I told her I had started datin' someone else durin' her contemplation. It was a lie, born from fear of rejection. She quickly made it clear that she couldn’t date me as long as I was with someone else. However, she was willin' to remain friends, which I accepted. I loved callin' her “bestie,” knowin' that if my relationship ever faltered, I could pursue her.
        <br><br>
        Our connection deepened, becomin' somethin' special—more than just a romance. Days turned into months, and as nearly a year of friendship passed, we found ourselves navigatin' the beautiful complexities of our bond doh!
        </p>

        <h3>The Unfoldin' of Hidden Feelin's</h3>
        <p>
          Then came a pivotal moment: Fatmata shared that she was now datin' someone else. I was happy for her, yet deep inside, I felt a pang of jealousy, hahaha! I masked my true feelin's, pretendin' everythin' was fine, even as she struggled with her own emotions, haaa!!
          <br><br>
          As time went on, she confided in me about her relationship troubles. First, she mentioned that she wasn’t okay with her boyfriend, and although they managed to resolve it, the tension remained. Then, she revealed somethin' even more troublin': <b style="color: red;">her boyfriend was pressurin' her for s*x,</b> threatenin' to  break up if she didn’t omply. My heart sank hearin' this; I felt anger and concern for her well-bein'.
          <br><br>
          I urged her to stand her ground, reassurin' her, <b><i>“Bestie, I may not be able to do everythin' your boyfriend does, but I’m here to keep you happy and stress-free.”</i></b> To my delight, she eventually broke up with him, and I couldn’t contain my joy. It felt like a prayer had been answered innit, hahaha! Don't stop readin', continue to complete everythin'
          <br><br>
          We continued our friendship, filled with laughter and encouragement, makin' light of her past experiences to help her heal. It was a beautiful way to strengthen our bond, inchin' us closer  to the feelin's we had both been hidin'. Move next to see the touchin' part...
        </p>

        <h3>A Night of Revelation</h3>
        <p>
        One beautiful night, under the shimmerin' moon and a cool breeze, Fatmata and I found ourselves in a heartfelt conversation about our feelin's for each other. The atmosphere was magical, and I felt   compelled to share my truth.
        <br><br>
        “Fatmata, <b style="color: green;">I truly love you</b>,” I confessed. “But I’m torn about how to handle my situation with Fatimah (the girl I was datin' at first). I don’t want to be a cheater, yet my heart is pullin' me toward you.” 
        <br><br>
        As we spoke, I began to compare the two relationships. Fatmata’s devotion shone through in every word, and I realized she had been there for me from the start, like a couple should be. It was funny, yet bittersweet, to learn that she had been screenshottin' every status I posted with Fatimah. Each one hurt her, yet she couldn’t resist doin' it time and again.
        <br><br>
        That night, she opened up about how my relationship with Fatimah made her feel, and I found myself fallin' deeper in love with her in stead. But the question loomed: how could I leave my girlfriend for Fatmata? But find out what happened...
        <br><br>
        In a moment of desperation, I sought advice from my personal assistant, hopin' for clarity. I listed everythin' that mattered to me. Through this exercise, one thin' became crystal clear: my heart belonged to Fatmata (my bestie). 
        <br><br>
        I reflected on the shortcomin's of my relationship with Fatimah; our communication was poor, and while she was often online, she rarely had time for me. My focus naturally shifted to Fatmata, who made me feel valued and cherished. 
        <br><br>
        It was time to make a decision. Both relationships were long-distance, but the connection I had with Fatmata felt more real, more vibrant. I was ready to embrace my feelin's and take the leap toward love.
        </p>

        <h3>The Heartbreak and the Turnin' Point</h3>
        <p>
        After two days of reflection and comparison, I knew in my heart that Fatmata was the right girl for me. One night, she encouraged me to break up with my girlfriend, promisin' to be there for me and treat me with the love I deserved. I agreed, but as the words formed in my mind, my heart felt heavy. 
        <br /><br />
        In a moment of fear and confusion, I made the decision to reject Fatmata (my bestie). I sent her a polite yet heartbreakin' message, explainin' that I still had feelin's for Fatimah and that our future together didn’t seem written in the stars. The moment I hit send, I felt a wave of regret wash over me. I could almost hear her heart shatter as she read my dangerous message. 
        <br /><br />
        Fatmata was frozen, her heart breakin' while I struggled with my own feelin's of guilt. I had promised to make her happy if her boyfriend ever broke up with her, and now I felt like I’d betrayed that vow. That night, I opened up to Fatimah (my girlfriend ) about everythin'. To my surprise, she  told me she had no problem if I wanted to date someone else, sayin' it would give my heart peace. Her words touched me deeply, and I found myself lovin' her even more. 
        <br /><br />
        Meanwhile, Fatmata was left in tears, sleepless and heartbroken from my poisoned words. The next mornin', she couldn’t attend a work place, spendin' the day cryin' indoors. I couldn’t bear the thought of her sufferin', so I reached out, but she didn’t pick up. When I finally managed to connect with her that night, we talked and laughed through our tears, sharin' a bittersweet  connection that felt both painful and beautiful, I can't imagine that day, I feel like cryin' new fresh.
        <br /><br />
        In the midst of this turmoil (trouble), another character entered our story: Ruqayah, Fatmata’s close friend, almost like a sister. She reached out to me, expressin' concern over Fatmata’s heartbreak. Ruqayah  emphasized how deeply Fatmata cared for me and how my words had affected her. Hearin' this made me realize the gravity of the situation.
        <br /><br />
        Determined to make thin's right, I asked Ruqayah to facilitate a conversation between Fatmata and me. When the opportunity arose, I reached out to her, confessin' that I was ready to accept my feelin's for her. I cautioned her that jealousy would be a challenge for me, but I was committed to brin' back her happiness. 
        <br /><br />
        To my relief, Fatmata smiled as we talked, and I made her laugh with my kind words. It felt like a fresh start, a chance to mend what had been broken. 
        <br /><br />
        Meanwhile, I transferred my previous message to Fatimah, but her lack of response only solidified my feelin's for Fatmata. I realized that Fatimah’s indifference wiped away any lingerin' affection I had for her. 
        <br /><br />
        Encouragin' Fatmata to be strong, I showed her the message I had sent to Fatimah, hopin' to build trust between us. With each passin' day, our love began to grow anew, fresh and vibrant, like a flower bloomin' after a long winter.
        </p>

        <h3>A Love That Strengthened</h3>
        <p>
        Our relationship felt stronger than ever, yet I found myself grapplin' with lingerin' feelin's for my ex, Fatimah. Despite her lack of concern for our love, I secretly encouraged her, tellin' her how much I cared. She reciprocated, sayin' she loved me even more, which only troubled my heart further. I wanted to hear her voice, to see her once more, but my calls went unanswered, leavin' me feelin' blocked and confused.
        <br><br>
        Then came the day Fatimah visited my place for a college allocation meetin'. We spent a few hours together, and as she left, I felt a pang of loss that echoed in my heart. That was the last time I would see her, and from that moment on, she disappeared from my life—no texts, no calls, nothin'. The pain was palpable, but my beloved Fatmata was there to lift me up. She encouraged me to let go of the past, and with each passin' day, she brought joy back into my life.
        <br><br>
        Fatmata and I shared laughter and late-night conversations, often usin' WhatsApp calls to build trust and understandin'. She made me feel valued and cherished, even as jealousy crept into my heart. Months passed, and when she finally visited me for the first time, we spent a cheerful day together. As mornin' approached and it was time for her to leave, I felt a longin' to keep her by my side forever.
        <br><br>
        In a moment of happiness, she turned back, and we shared a laugh, realizin' we had overcome any physical challenges that might have stood in our way. My love for her grew even stronger, and I felt a sense of hope for our future together. 
        <br><br>
        We didn’t know what the next chapter would hold, but we were ready to face it side by side, embracin' every moment filled with joy, laughter, and love.
